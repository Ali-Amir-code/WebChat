# WebChat

A simple web-based chat app.

## Overview

WebChat is a lightweight, real-time chat application built with JavaScript. The project aims to provide a straightforward, easy-to-use platform for users to communicate instantly via a web interface. It serves as a foundational example for learning about web sockets, real-time communication, and front-end/back-end integration in web applications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Send and receive messages instantly.
- **User Authentication:** Basic login/logout functionality.
- **Chat Rooms:** Optionally join different chat rooms or channels.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean and responsive design for various screen sizes.
- **Notifications:** Alerts for new messages.
- **User List:** See who is online in a chat room.
